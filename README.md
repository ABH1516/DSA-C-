This repository contains my *Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)* practice solutions implemented in *C++*.

Actively building this as preparation for technical interviews and campus placements (MCA 2026 batch). Focus on clean, efficient, and well-commented code with optimal time/space complexity.

Problems sourced from GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, and standard DSA textbooks. Currently covering fundamentals + expanding into Recursion, Strings, and more advanced topics!

### Topic Folders (Expanding!)
- *Array/* → Advanced array manipulations and problems.
- *Maths/* → Mathematical and number theory problems (primes, GCD, etc.).
- *Recursion/* → Recursion-based solutions (backtracking, divide & conquer).
- *String/* → String manipulation, patterns, and algorithms.

(Adding code + detailed READMEs inside folders soon!)

## 🔧 How to Compile & Run
Standard C++ files — compile with g++:

```bash
g++ -o output filename.cpp
./output
